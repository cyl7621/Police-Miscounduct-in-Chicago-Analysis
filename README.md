# Police-Miscounduct-in-Chicago-Analysis
This project analyzes police performance in Chicago between 2007 and 2017. A dashboard with interactive features was created to summarize the findings.
Some of the highlights on this dashboard:
 - When checking the allegation count for each year, you can move the cursor on the top "Allegations Count" line chart to see the exact number, and the police performance index will also change accordingly on the lower left "Police Performance Index" bar chat based on the year your cursor selected. 
 - The lower right section shows the top 10 alleged police officer. The bar chart represents the average misconduct incidents per year for these top 10 police officers. When you move the cursor on each bar, the associated police officers information (such as name, gender, rank, salary,etc.) will be showed up.
